				<p>Sitar player and composer Anoushka Shankar is one of the leading figures in World Music today. She is deeply rooted in the Indian classical music she studied exclusively from the age of nine under her father and guru, the legendary Ravi Shankar. Among various accolades she has been thrice nominated for a Grammy Award and was the youngest, and first female, recipient of a House of Commons Shield from the British House of Parliament in 1999. Before turning twenty she made three classical sitar records for Angel/EMI under the guidance of her father, and received her first Grammy nomination, thereby becoming the first Indian female and youngest-ever nominee in the World Music category.</p>
	
				<p>Now, in 2013, Anoushka releases Traces of You, having enlisted the help of multi-award-winning musician Nitin Sawhney to produce her music.Today, from her home in London, where she lives with her husband and son, Anoushka’s career reflects her aim to constantly learn and grow as an artist. As Nitin Sawhney has written, “No one embodies the spirit of innovation and experimentation more evidently than Anoushka Shankar. </p>
